The programming values knowledge, reciprocity, and accountability among the participants. Because mainstream arts organizations have largely failed the Latinx visual arts community, Latinx artists are creating their own space through Serpentina Arts programming. Meetings are designed to create a safe place to provide a sense of belonging and decrease social isolation, strengthen artwork through conversations regarding related topics, share artistic accomplishments, and network to share opportunities. Intentional comradeship will motivate solidarity to achieve similar professional aspirations through collective action. -Tina (Project Coordinator)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#serpentina-arts-project","text":"As a part of my Writing with Digital Technology class at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, I worked collaboratively with my classmates and an artist community called Serpentina Arts whose goal is to give Latinx Artists , who are often under-represented, a platform for exhibition.

The bio-narrative was concise enough to place on a placard next to a hanging piece of art\u2014or a quick introduction for an audience at a film festival\u2014yet it contained enough pertinent and interesting information about the life of the artist that would satisfy a curious art enthusiast. Revisions Some more correspondence was necessary to gather more information in order to fill out the gaps in the biography. The artist was happy to cooperate with the various emails and interviews. That's it!

Conducting the Interview with Covid-19 precautions in effect, the interview was not a traditional in-person interview. We decided to conduct the interviews via a Zoom video conferencing application to be safe. Recording the Interview It was important to get permission from the interviewee before we actually recorded the conversation. Once permission was obtained, we then made sure that the artist understood they did not have to answer any question that they didn't want to. Familiarity with the Zoom application was important as recording properly could save one from an embarrassing do-over. Transcribing the Interview The Zoom application allows you to record and auto transcribe the conversation. This was one benefit of conducting the interview via Zoom over in-person. Once the interview was complete, the transcription of the audio was to be edited for accuracy. Viewing the recording and comparing it against the transcription helped to fix any errors in which the Zoom auto transcribe was inaccurate.","title":"Interview Process"},{"location":"interview-process/#interview-process","text":"The following is the process by which we conducted our interview for the bio.","title":"Interview Process"},{"location":"interview-process/#conducting-the-interview","text":"with Covid-19 precautions in effect, the interview was not a traditional in-person interview.

My Writing with Digital Technology class took on the task of writing artist bios for any Serpentina Arts member who wanted one. Project Steps Over the course of the fall semester 2021 our Writing with Digital Technology class worked in pairs (or individually) to: Schedule the initial interview meeting Develop interview questions and an interview plan Conduct an interview using Zoom technology follow up with interviewee later in the process Draft two biographies one full-length bio one shorter, 150 character Tweet-length bio Deliver finished bio to the artist At this point in the process, my partner and artist are at step 4. We have yet to do a follow up interview and deliver the finished bio. This site will be updated when those milestones have been reached.","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"project-overview/#project-overview","text":"The Serpentina Arts community's goal is to give under-represented Latinx Artists a platform to exhibit their artwork.
