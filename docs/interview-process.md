# Interview Process

The following is the process by which we conducted our interview for the bio.

### Conducting the Interview
with Covid-19 precautions in effect, the interview was not a traditional in-person interview. We decided to conduct the interviews via a Zoom video conferencing application to be safe. 

### Recording the Interview
It was important to get permission from the interviewee before we actually recorded the conversation. Once permission was obtained, we then made sure that the artist understood they did not have to answer any question that they didn't want to. 

Familiarity with the Zoom application was important as recording properly could save one from an embarrassing do-over.

### Transcribing the Interview
The Zoom application allows you to record and auto transcribe the conversation. This was one benefit of conducting the interview via Zoom over in-person. Once the interview was complete, the transcription of the audio was to be edited for accuracy. Viewing the recording and comparing it against the transcription helped to fix any errors in which the Zoom auto transcribe was inaccurate.
