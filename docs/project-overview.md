# Project Overview

The Serpentina Arts community's goal is to give under-represented **Latinx Artists** a platform to exhibit their artwork. My Writing with Digital Technology class took on the task of writing artist bios for any Serpentina Arts member who wanted one. 

## Project Steps
Over the course of the fall semester 2021 our Writing with Digital Technology class worked in pairs (or individually) to:

1. Schedule the initial interview meeting
2. Develop interview questions and an interview plan
3. Conduct an interview using Zoom technology
    * follow up with interviewee later in the process
4. Draft two biographies
    * one full-length bio 
    * one shorter, 150 character Tweet-length bio
5. Deliver finished bio to the artist

At this point in the process, my partner and artist are at step 4. We have yet to do a follow up interview and deliver the finished bio. This site will be updated when those milestones have been reached.
