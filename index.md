As a part of my Writing with Digital Technologies class at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, we worked with the Serpentina Arts community, whose goal is to give Latinx artists a platform for exhibition and to create a unique an artist bio for each artist. The artist can use the artist's bio in any way they see fit. Here is a link to the Serpentina Artist Community page.
This site explains how we created and delivered a finished artist biography in three steps:

## About Serpentina Arts
Serpentina Arts is a robust roster of Minnesota Latinx visual artists who have a record of creative presence in Minnesota, are innovative participants in coalition-building, and are diverse in age, artistic media, race, genders, sexualities, educational backgrounds, and cultural heritage. The programming values knowledge, reciprocity, and accountability among the participants.

Because mainstream arts organizations have largely failed the Latinx visual arts community, Latinx artists are creating their own space through Serpentina Arts programming. Meetings are designed to create a safe place to provide a sense of belonging and decrease social isolation, strengthen artwork through conversations regarding related topics, share artistic accomplishments, and network to share opportunities. Intentional comradeship will motivate solidarity to achieve similar professional aspirations through collective action.
