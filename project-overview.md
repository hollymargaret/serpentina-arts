# Project Overview

The Serpentina Arts communityâ€™s goal is to give under-represented **Latinx Artists** a platform to exhibit their artwork. Therefore, our Writing with Digital Technology class synergistically offered to write bios for Serpentina artists who needed one, giving us writing practice and a marketing tool for them.

## Project Steps
Over the course of the fall semester 2021 our Writing with Digital Technology class worked in pairs (or individually) to:

1. Schedule the initial interview meeting
2. Develop interview questions and an interview plan
3. Conduct an interview using Zoom technology
    * follow up with the interview later in the process
4. Draft two biographies
    * one full-length bio 
    * one shorter, 150 character Tweet-length bio
5. Deliver finished bio to the artist
